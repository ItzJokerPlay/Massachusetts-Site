		<p>Massachusetts is a state full of history. The first Thanksgiving was celebrated in Plymouth Massachusetts. In 1788 Massachusetts became the 6th U.S state. The first major military engagement of the American Revolutionary war took place near Boston, and many more battles such as the Boston Tea Party took place in the Massachusetts area. On the first day of September in 1897 Boston opened the first subway  in the United States. Many U.S presidents were born in Massachusetts such as John Adams, John F. Kennedy, and a couple more. In Boston, Massachusetts there have been many acts of terrorism, but one the most remembered ones happened on April 15, 2013 where two bombs went off in the annual Boston Marathon about 200 yards apart from the finish line. Also, the two planes that crashed into the twin towers took off from the Boston Logan Airport.</p>
